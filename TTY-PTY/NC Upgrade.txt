First, background your netcat shell by typing:

Ctrl+z

This will appear as though you’ve lost your shell. Don’t worry! We’ll get it back. Next, in your local shell type:

stty raw -echo

Finally, foreground the netcat shell by typing:

fg + [Enter x 2]

This should return your shell with tab auto-completion!
